# Random Quote Generator

### Requirements
*  Must have an array named `quotes` of at least 5 objects
*  Each quote object must have `quote`, `source`, `citation`, `date`, and `tags` properties.
*  Must have a `getRandomQuote()` function that returns a random object from the `quotes` array.
*  `getRandomQuote()` must not return a duplicate quote until all quotes have been viewed at least once.
*  Must have a `printQuote()` function that invokes `getRandomQuote()` and rewrites the HTML of the `quote-box` div.
*  `printQuote()` must also change the background color to a random RGB value.
*  `printQuote()` must be bound to a `button` click event handler as well as the `Window.setInterval()` method.
*  When `printQuote()` is invoked, it must log the quote to the console as well.
*  Code must be well commented!
