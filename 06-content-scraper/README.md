# Build a Content Scraper

### Requirements

#### Command Line Interface and Dependency Management
:white_check_mark: Project includes a `package.json` file containing dependencies to run `node scraper.js`.  
:white_check_mark: Running `npm install` installs relevant dependencies.  
:white_check_mark: The `scraper.js` file can be run with the `npm start` command.

#### Folder Generation
:white_check_mark: Program creates one `data` folder, if that folder doesnâ€™t already exist. If the folder does exist, the program does nothing.

#### Research npm packages
:white_check_mark: Chosen scraping and CSV packages have at least 1,000 downloads and have been updated in the last 6 months on NPM.

#### Crawling
:white_check_mark: The project uses the [http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php](http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php) URL as an entry point to look through the links on the page to find 8 shirts.

#### Scraping and Saving Data
:white_check_mark: Project scrapes the product title, price, image and url, and all information is correct and in the correct place.  
:white_check_mark: A CSV is successfully saved to the `data` folder in this format: `YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, e.g. `2016-12-30.csv`.  
:white_check_mark: Column headers are in this order: Title, Price, ImageURL, URL, Time.

#### Overwriting Data
:white_check_mark: If the script is run twice, the program overwrites the data. The file contains the data from the second call.

#### Error Handling
:white_check_mark: The program displays a human-friendly error (not just the original error code) when it cannot connect to [http://shirts4mike.com](http://shirts4mike.com).  
:white_check_mark: Program logs errors in a `scraper-error.log` file.  
:white_check_mark: New errors append to the end of the file with a timestamp, e.g. `[Tue Feb 16 2016 13:00:55 GMT-0800 (PST)] <error message>`.

### Instructions
1. [Download](https://github.com/adamelliotfields/treehouse-content-scraper/raw/master/treehouse-content-scraper.zip) and extract `treehouse-content-scraper.zip`.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` within the project folder to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` within the project folder to run the program.

### Notes
This app was written in ES2015, but I've compiled it to ES5 with Babel to support older versions of Node. The original code is in the `src` folder.  

I'm also using Bluebird for promises instead of native ES2015 promises to support older versions of Node.  

I've tested it on Node 7.9.0 (latest), 6.10.2 (current LTS), and 4.8.2 (previous LTS).
